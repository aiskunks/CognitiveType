# CognitiveType
The Cognitive Type project

*Mapping Typography to Cognition*

The Cognitive Type project has two main objectives: 
1) To develop eye tracking tools using the Klee library that allow for the real-time mapping of type to cognition 
and 2) the creation of computational tools that allow for the easy design of typefaces with cognitive properties such as readability.

These tools will allow designers to know whether a typeface is readabile for kids, or dyslexics or adults and what changes to make if the type has issues. They will also allow for the analysis of the sentiment (e.g. disgust or excitment) of a use of type in a design.
