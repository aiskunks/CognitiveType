The TMNIST datasets are datasets to help AI research in type and hand writing recognition and generation.

The TMNIST dataset contains over half a million images of multiple glyphs from a set of 1,812 unique glyphs in over 2,900 font styles.

The data is split into many smaller datasets for ease use of use. 

Currently the datasets are:
