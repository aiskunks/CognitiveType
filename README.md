The Cognitive Type project

*Mapping Typography to Cognition*

The Cognitive Type project has two main objectives: 
1) To develop eye-tracking tools using the Klee library that allow for the real-time mapping of type to cognition. 
and 2) tools that allow for the easy design of typefaces with cognitive properties such as readability.

These tools will allow designers to know whether a typeface is readable for kids, or dyslexics, or adults and what changes to make if the type has issues. They will also allow for the analysis of the sentiment (e.g. disgust or excitement) of the use of type in a design.

The basic idea is that it is well known that different typefaces have different cognitive properties. Most people will find some type more readable or more beautiful. What is not known is exactly which visual characteristics of a type such as a serif, the x-height map to visual properties like readability or beauty. Recent advances in AI now allow us to create tools that map visual characteristics of type to cognition. The Cognitive Type Project is about creating these tools which will allow for such things as better click-through rates on Google ads, children's books that improve reading levels, or companies that better understand how their customers react to the text in their media.
