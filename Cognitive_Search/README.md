# Cognitive Search

Cognitive search involves using deep learning to predict eye tracking data in real-time.  This allows one to search images for cogntive traits. For example, to search images that people fing beautiful rather than those tagged with the word "beautiful."

Most studies seem to be able create deep learning to predict eye tracking data at around 95% accuracy.
