# The Cognitive Type project

*Mapping Typography to Cognition*

The Cognitive Type Project is about creating computational tools which will allow the design of beautiful typefaces which have different cognitive properties. This will allow typographers to design type for such things as better click-through rates on Google ads, children's books that improve reading levels, or companies that better understand how their customers react to the text in their media.Â 

The basic idea is that it is well known that different typefaces have different cognitive properties. Most people will find some type more readable or more beautiful. What is not known is exactly which visual characteristics of a type such as a serif, the x-height map to visual properties like readability or beauty. Recent advances in AI now allow us to create tools that map visual characteristics of type to cognition.
